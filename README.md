# Bikesharing visualisation with NYC CitiBike data

## Overview
Purpose of this analysis is to present a solid business proposal to key stakeholders with a review of a bike trip analysis for New York City using Tableau and present it to key stakeholders for a bike trip analysis. Data will have type modification using Python in Jupyter Notebook

## Results

## Summary
In conclusion, bikeshare services are very popular in busy metropolitan areas like NYC with dense population and scarce parking spaces. The program is funded by subscribers, mainly male. More outreach should be done to attract female riders. The main bike usage is focused around morning and evening commute hours.

If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization with the data provided, I would consider a deeper dive into:

* trip starting and ending locations during weekday rush hours to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods;
* average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders according to their age.
